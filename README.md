# Programs used for the paper "Do Risk Preferences Really Matter? The Case of Pesticide Use in Agriculture ",
*Christophe Bontemps, Douadia Bougherara, CÃ©line Nauges*, published in  Environmental Modeling and Assessment, 2021 

All the programs were written to be reproducible at the time of the publication, provide that the packages are installed, and should run smoothly^[ These programs were written in 2021 and I will not provide any support if this is not the case anymore (sorry!)] 

### Files

The *.Rmd* file is the main program generating all the simulations and figures of the paper, while the R programs are fucntions used in this markdown file. All files must be in the same directory. 

**Enjoy!** 

PS: There is also a shiny app in anothe GitHub repo. This provides an interactive webpage to test how the choice of aversion forms and parameters affect different outcomes. This Shiny application was primilary used for us to "understand" some risk-aversion properties, the interface is then not polishged (but should work still). 
See the repo "Flatness" and/or the shiny app https://xtophedataviz.shinyapps.io/Flatness2/
