# Programs used for the paper "Do Risk Preferences Really Matter? The Case of Pesticide Use in Agriculture ",
*Christophe Bontemps, Douadia Bougherara, CÃ©line Nauges*, published in  Environmental Modeling and Assessment, 2021 

All the programs were written to be reproducible at the time of the publication, provide that the packages are installed, and should run smoothly^[ These programs were written in 2021 and I will not provide any support if this is not the case anymore (sorry!)] 

### Files

The *.Rmd* file is the main program generating all the simulations and figures of the paper, while the R-shiny programs *ui.R* and *server.R*  provide an interactive webpage to test how the choice of aversion forms and parameters affect different outcomes. As for any shiny app, the two programs must be in the same directory. 

**Enjoy!**
